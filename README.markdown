# HoWoMo (Houses of Worship in mid-Missouri) #

In the strictest sense, this code creates a map of houses of worship
in mid-Missouri separated by denomination. See the map in action at
[The Center on Religion & the Professions][1], for whom the code was
created.

But the code can be reconfigured for your own mapping needs by
substituting a different Google Fusion Table, at least if your table
is organized as the original is. If you're not interested in houses of
worship, then you can use this code as a starting point for your own
map of whatever.
